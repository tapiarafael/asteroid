# Asteroid Game

Welcome to the **Asteroid Game**! This project was created as part of the Boot.dev course to practice Python programming. The game is a simple yet fun implementation of an asteroid field simulation, where you can explore concepts like object-oriented programming, game physics, and more.

## Features

- **Asteroid Splitting**: Asteroids split into smaller pieces when destroyed.
- **Player Interaction**: Control a player to navigate through the asteroid field.
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic movement and collision handling.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into multiple Python modules for clarity and reusability.

## Project Structure

```
asteroid.py         # Defines the Asteroid class
asteroidfield.py    # Manages the asteroid field
circleshape.py      # Base class for circular shapes
constants.py        # Stores game constants
improvements.txt    # Notes for future improvements
main.py             # Entry point for the game
player.py           # Defines the Player class
requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
shot.py             # Handles player shots
__pycache__/        # Compiled Python files
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `pygame` library
